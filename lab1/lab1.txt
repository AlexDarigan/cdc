Lab 1:
1. Check if your processor supports Intel/AMD virtualization technology. Enable Intel virtualization technology in BIOS if possible.

2. The cloud is almost everywhere in our lives now. What do you think are the fundamental reasons behind its success? Name three pros and three cons of cloud.

Pros

    Accessibility
    
        The cloud allows us to access all of our data from anywhere at anytime provided we have a functional networked device.

    Storage
    
        By loading off resources to the cloud, we have more available storage on our personal devices
     
    Disaster Recovery
    
        When a single device fails, any data on that device may be lost forever. With cloud, redundancy is built into data storage that helps
        prevent that data from being completely lost despite disasters.

Cons
    
    Network Reliance

        Without access to any functional network connection, none of the data in the cloud may be accessed. Additionally, depending on the size of
        the data, it might take a while to transfer from the cloud to physical devices. 

    Security

        Any data available on the cloud has a larger attack vector. Since any machine with a network connection can access the cloud, that means bad actors
        may also access it, if they find any vunerable exploits.

    Control

        You usually don't own your own cloud storage. Individuals and Businesses alike tend to pay a subscription service to a cloud storage provider (after the
        free tier limits have been passed). This means your cloud storage provider is in control of your data, it is as secure as they are. You may not want to store
        some of your more sensitive data due to this.

3. What is the primary function of a hypervisor in virtualization?

4. What is a virtual machine (VM)?

5. What are the benefits of using virtual machines?

6. List five use cases of virtual machines.

7. In virtualization, what is the guest operating system?

    b) The operating system installed on a virtual machine

8. What does virtual machine isolation mean?

    c) Virtual machines run independently and are isolated from each other and the host system.

9. What is the benefit of virtual machine portability?

    c) It allows virtual machines to be moved between different physical machines with compatible hypervisors.

10. What is the purpose of cloning a virtual machine?
